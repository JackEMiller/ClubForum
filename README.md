For use cases, database design and other graphical documentation Lucid boards was used to build these

Lucid boards has many templates and pre-loaded shapes for quick and easy construction of graphical documentaion, I would highly recommend this.

### Architecture and software tools used:
Google cloud will be used to host the virtual envinronment

MySQL is used for the database logic and storage

The main logic is written in Python

Flask is used to build the web framework of the application

A Version Control System is used to manage changes to the application and development, this is used with Git in conjuction with GitHub to host

The PyTest and unit test libraries are used to test the CRUD functions of the application, using white and black box testing methods
